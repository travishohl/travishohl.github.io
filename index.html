    <ul class="pain-points">
      <li>Systems that create more work than they save</li>
      <li>Recurring errors that nobody has time to investigate</li>
      <li>Manual processes that should be automated</li>
      <li>Technology decisions made without a clear strategy</li>
      <li>Developers who write code but don't solve the underlying problem</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You don't need another developer. You need someone who can look at your systems holistically, identify where things are breaking down, and implement targeted solutions that actually move the needle.

    <p>
      Most technical problems aren't really technical problems—they're business process problems wearing a technical disguise. My approach focuses on understanding the full picture before writing any code.

      <p class="case-study__label">Case Study</p>
      <h3 class="case-study__title">Data-Driven Error Reduction</h3>

      <div class="case-study__section">
        <strong>The Challenge</strong>
        A data import process was generating hundreds of errors daily. The team was spending significant time handling these case-by-case, treating each error as a unique problem to solve.
      </div>

      <div class="case-study__section">
        <strong>The Approach</strong>
        Rather than treating symptoms, I analyzed the error patterns using database queries. By joining data from multiple sources and grouping errors by frequency, I identified the true distribution of problems—something that wasn't visible when handling errors one at a time.
      </div>

      <div class="case-study__result">
        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> 75% of all errors stemmed from just 1-2 root causes. Two targeted fixes eliminated the majority of the problem—work that would have taken weeks of case-by-case handling.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="case-study__insight">
        The fix wasn't more error handling code. It was asking the right questions of the data.

      <p class="case-study__label">Case Study</p>
      <h3 class="case-study__title">PTA Signup Friction Analysis</h3>

      <div class="case-study__section">
        <strong>The Challenge</strong>
        Parents signing up for their school's PTA through a national membership site face a frustrating experience—scrolling through long dropdown lists to find their specific PTA among thousands of options.
      </div>

      <div class="case-study__section">
        <strong>The Analysis</strong>
        This UX friction likely causes abandonment and reduces PTA membership. The current interface puts the burden on users to locate their organization, when the PTA already knows exactly which organization they want parents to join.
      </div>

      <div class="case-study__section">
        <strong>The Proposed Solution</strong>
        Allow PTAs to generate direct signup links with URL parameters that pre-select their organization. PTAs could share these links in school communications, eliminating the search friction entirely.
      </div>

      <div class="case-study__result">
        <p><strong>Expected Impact:</strong> Higher conversion rates, less frustration, more PTA members—achieved by removing a step rather than adding features.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="case-study__insight">
        Sometimes the biggest impact comes from removing friction, not adding features.

  <div class="container">
    <h2 id="about-title">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Travis Hohl, a software developer with over 10 years of experience building web applications in PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Ruby. But what I've learned over that decade is that writing code is the easy part—understanding the problem is where the real work happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked with companies of all sizes, from startups to enterprises, and the pattern is always the same: the best solutions come from stepping back, asking questions, and understanding the system as a whole before diving into implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm based in Austin, Texas and work remotely with clients who value strategic thinking over quick fixes. If you're looking for someone to help you build systems that actually work for your business, I'd love to hear from you.
