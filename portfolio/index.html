                    <p>Originally completed in May 2013 and redesigned in January 2016, this website was built with <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and the Bootstrap front-end framework. It features a number of main graphic areas whose images use <code>background-attachment: fixed</code>, as opposed to hijacking the scroll event, to provide an illusion of depth. In order to keep the focal point of these images aligned within the main graphic element, the images are initially positioned with JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>This is a "web scraping" application developed using the Ruby on Rails framework. Once completed, it will periodically read the statutes published on <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/" target="_blank">the Texas Legislature's website</a>, reformat them, and display them in a way that is easier to read and more accessible to users with disabilities. The application will also implement an API that will allow other developers to access its data in a machine-readable format.</p>

                    <p>Demo App is a simple iOS application written in Objective C. It implements a counter that increments itself and toggles the app's background color (from blue to red and vice versa) in response to user touches. When the counter reaches some multiple of ten, the application triggers an alert to the user to notify them of the number of touches and allow the user to either reset the counter or continue. I wrote the application in order to better understand topics related to Apple's Cocoa (iOS) framework, including Cocoa classes and subclassing, Cocoa events, and animation.</p>
